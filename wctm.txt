Problem Statement 1: AiMl for networking

Create an ai model using ml that should be able to classify network type and any one threat detection chosen by you.

We have to submit the project in the well mannered structure shared by intel on the github.

The first file should be of documentation that may including the following:
1.which problem Statement u r working upon.
2.How many members are working.
3.The architecture diagram.
4.Code being implied by you. Just explain it.
5. Also share a video of implementation of that ai model in a different file.

Take any online data set. Any python library u want.
